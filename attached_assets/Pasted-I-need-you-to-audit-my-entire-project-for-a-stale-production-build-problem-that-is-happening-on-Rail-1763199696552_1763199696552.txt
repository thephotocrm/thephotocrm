I need you to audit my entire project for a stale-production-build problem that is happening on Railway.

Here’s the situation I need you to investigate deeply:

1. Railway keeps serving an old JS bundle (index-BX8c74U8.js) on my custom domain (*.tpcportal.co), even though my latest code should produce a new hashed bundle.

2. I need you to find out whether:
   - I accidentally committed a dist/ or build/ or server/public/ folder to git
   - My build command is outputting to the wrong place
   - Vite is not generating new content hashes
   - The server is serving stale files from a folder I’m unaware of
   - There are old assets sitting inside server/public or another static directory
   - The Express static path is pointing somewhere unexpected

3. Inspect:
   - vite.config.*
   - server/index.ts
   - server/vite.ts
   - Any file that defines static or public paths
   - My build command and package.json scripts
   - The folder structure inside my repo

4. After reviewing everything, tell me:
   - Where the stale JS file might be lingering
   - Whether my repo is storing old build artifacts
   - Whether my Vite hash output is configured correctly
   - Whether Express is serving files from the location Railway deploys
   - Whether anything about my config would prevent Vite from generating new hashes

5. Then propose a **fix plan** that guarantees:
   - Vite always generates a new hashed bundle on every deploy
   - No stale assets exist in the repo or deployment output
   - Express always serves only fresh assets
   - Cache-busting works correctly in production
   - No leftover folders or files can cause Railway to keep serving old bundles

6. Also generate:
   - A correct .gitignore for a Vite + Node + Express monorepo
   - A correct build → serve pipeline
   - Any changes needed to vite.config to ensure strong hashing
   - Any improvements to server/static config to prevent accidental serving of old files

This is a **critical production issue**, so be extremely thorough. Search the entire repo and identify every possible path where stale files might survive a rebuild.
