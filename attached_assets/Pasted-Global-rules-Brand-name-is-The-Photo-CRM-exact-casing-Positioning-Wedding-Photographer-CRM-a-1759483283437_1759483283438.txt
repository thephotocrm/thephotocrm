Global rules

Brand name is The Photo CRM (exact casing).

Positioning: “Wedding Photographer CRM” as a descriptor throughout the page.

Primary CTA text must be identical everywhere: Start Free 14-Day Trial.

Secondary CTA (ghost) when used: Watch 90-Second Demo.

Reuse existing Tailwind/styles/components; no new dependencies.

Replace decorative icons in feature cards with screenshot placeholders (use <img> with meaningful alt, loading="lazy", and current card shells).

Keep one <h1> total on page (the existing hero). All other section headings are h2/h3.

Decorative icons should have aria-hidden="true".

Head/meta updates (outside hero)

<title> → The Photo CRM — Wedding Photographer CRM

<meta name="description"> → The Photo CRM: smart pipeline, automated email & SMS, beautiful proposals with Stripe payouts, and Google Calendar—for wedding photographers.

(If OG is present)

og:title: The Photo CRM — Wedding Photographer CRM

og:description: same as meta description

og:type: website

Proof bar (single line, outside hero)

Insert a small, subtle proof line once (e.g., under the next section title or as a thin bar after the hero, but not inside the hero):

Integrates with Gmail • Stripe • Google Calendar

SECTION BY SECTION CHANGES (non-hero only)
1) Pain → Outcome (replace current “Tired of juggling…” content)

Section heading (h2): Stop losing bookings to busywork.

Replace the three cards’ body copy and swap icons → screenshot placeholders:

Title: Missed follow-ups kill bookings.
Body: Automations keep every lead warm.
Image placeholder: <img src="/assets/pipeline-placeholder.jpg" alt="Automation follow-up sequence screenshot" loading="lazy" class="rounded-md">

Title: Manual invoices eat your weekends.
Body: Proposals, deposits, payouts—done.
Image placeholder: <img src="/assets/proposals-placeholder.jpg" alt="Proposal and payment flow screenshot" loading="lazy" class="rounded-md">

Title: Scattered emails = lost details.
Body: Two-way SMS + Gmail sync, all in one timeline.
Image placeholder: <img src="/assets/inbox-placeholder.jpg" alt="Unified messages and email timeline screenshot" loading="lazy" class="rounded-md">

Keep the same layout/grid/shadows. Reduce heavy gradient saturation by ~15% if currently applied to these cards.

2) Core Features (replace “Everything you need in one place” content + order)

Section heading (h2): Everything you need for weddings—built in.
Section subhead (p): Stop switching between 5 tools. Run your studio from one place.

Reorder and replace each feature row (use existing two-column rows; left = card with gradient shell becomes a screenshot card; right = text; alternate orientation as you already do):

Smart Client Pipeline
h3: See every couple, stage by stage.
Body: Visual kanban from inquiry to gallery delivery. Drag & drop. Never lose the thread.
Image: <img src="/assets/pipeline.jpg" alt="Pipeline kanban view for wedding clients" loading="lazy" class="rounded-xl shadow-md">

Automated Communication
h3: Set it once, nurture forever.
Body: Email + SMS automations, 24 pre-written wedding templates in 5 visual styles, research-backed drip timing. Sends via your Gmail address.

Smart Scheduling
h3: Bookings that book themselves.
Body: Google Calendar business calendar, automatic confirmations, Meet links, no double-booking.
Image: <img src="/assets/scheduling.jpg" alt="Booking calendar synced with Google Calendar" loading="lazy" class="rounded-xl shadow-md">

Body: Dedicated business number. Couples reply normally; you see the full timeline in their profile.

h3: Clarity that grows your studio.
Body: Bookings, revenue, pipeline health, bottlenecks by stage.
Image: <img src="/assets/reports.jpg" alt="Studio performance dashboard and charts" loading="lazy" class="rounded-xl shadow-md">

Remove bouncy hover:scale-105 if it causes jitter; keep soft hover shadow.

3) How It Works (add a new section after Features)

Section heading (h2): How it works
Add a simple 3-step row or three equal cards:

Import & set stages — or start with our wedding preset.

Turn on automations — emails, SMS, proposals, and scheduling.

Shoot more, stress less — we handle the busywork.

Add a small proof line under this section:
Integrates with Gmail • Stripe • Google Calendar

4) Social Proof (replace “What you get when you join” grid)

Replace the existing benefit tiles with two testimonial cards (keep your card styles/shadows):

“I booked two weddings the first week from follow-ups I used to miss.”
— Jasmine K., Dallas Wedding Photographer

“Proposals look premium and deposits hit my Stripe the same day.”
— Mateo R., Austin Elopements

(Use placeholders for avatars if needed. Keep this section concise.)

5) Pricing (keep your two-card layout; tighten copy)

Section title (h2): Lock in Founder’s Pricing
Subtitle: First 100 photographers only. 14-day free trial, no card required.

Left card (Best Value):

Title: Founder’s Price

Price: $4.95 / month

Bullets:

6) FAQ (add above final CTA band)

Section heading (h2): FAQs
Add five Q&As:

Will couples text my personal phone? No. You get a dedicated business number.

How do payouts work? Stripe Connect pays directly to your Stripe account.

(If you have a head script area, you may add FAQ schema, otherwise skip.)
