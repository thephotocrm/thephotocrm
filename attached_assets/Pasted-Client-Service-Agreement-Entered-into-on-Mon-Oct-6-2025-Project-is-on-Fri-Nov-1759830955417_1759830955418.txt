- Editing of images and video for color temperature, cropping, and style (no removal of physical features such as tattoos, scars, or other permanent attributes).

**Highlight Video:** A stylized, cinematic 3-7 minute video capturing the essence of the wedding day with music overlay. It includes key moments but is not a full-length recording of the day’s events.

**Documentary Video:** A long-form edit that includes extended coverage of key events such as the ceremony, speeches, and first dance, with minimal creative cuts.

**Delivery Time:** While we strive to deliver all final products in a timely manner, during peak wedding season in Texas, delivery times may be extended. Videos, in particular, may require up to **two additional months** beyond the standard delivery timeframe. The Client agrees to this potential delay as part of the service agreement.

**Abbie Street Photo and Video Team:** Abbie Street Photo and Video operates as a team and hires contract workers to capture weddings. At any point, the Client may be assigned a different photographer or videographer. We are not obligated to introduce the Client to the assigned professional prior to the wedding day. The assigned professional will arrive on the wedding day to perform their services as agreed upon. The Client is **not guaranteed Dillon Pacholek as their lead shooter** unless explicitly stated in the selected package.

The final deliverables and timeline for delivery will be communicated to the Client before the wedding date.
