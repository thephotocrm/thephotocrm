Great question! Getting more leads = driving more traffic and converting more of it. Here’s a quick, high-impact plan using Lazy Photog plus a few proven wedding marketing tactics.

Quick wins inside Lazy Photog (do these this week)
- Create a high‑intent lead form
  - Include: name, email, phone (required for SMS), wedding date, venue, guest count, how they heard about you, budget.
  - Set default pipeline stage to New Inquiry and auto-tag lead source.
  - Publish the shareable link on your website, Instagram bio, and email signature. Use it at bridal shows too.
- Turn on instant autoresponders
  - Email: thank them, set expectations, link to your consult calendar, and attach a one-page pricing guide.
  - SMS: “Hi {First}, it’s Demo Photography Studio—got your inquiry! What’s your venue? Here’s my consult link: {link}”
  - Use the pre-written wedding templates to save time.
- Add a consult scheduler
  - Connect Google Calendar and set availability. Include the Meet link.
  - Drop the scheduler link into your form confirmation page and autoresponder.
- Build a 1‑click booking proposal (Smart File)
  - Include your top 3 global packages + add‑ons, contract, and invoice with a retainer via Stripe.
  - Keep it ready so you can send it immediately after a consult.
- Use two‑way SMS to follow up within 5 minutes
  - Create canned replies for common questions (availability, pricing, travel fees). Fast replies dramatically raise booking rates.

Drive more traffic/leads
- Website and SEO
  - Add your lead form to the hero section with a strong CTA.
  - Publish 3 venue spotlight posts (e.g., “Best Wedding Photo Spots at [Venue]”) and link each to your lead form.
  - Keep your Google Business Profile updated; add recent weddings, FAQs, and a direct “Request a Quote” link to your form.
- Social and ads
  - Run a simple Instagram/FB campaign to engaged couples within 25–40 miles. Offer a free Wedding Timeline PDF gated by your lead form.
  - Feature carousel posts/reels with before/after edits and “Book a consult” linking to your scheduler.
- Vendor and referral partnerships
  - Create a vendor-friendly pricing PDF and send it to planners and venues; offer fast-turnaround previews they can share.
  - Set up a post-delivery automation asking clients for reviews and referrals (include a small print credit incentive).

Reactivation and nurture
- Warm up past inquiries
  - Filter inquiries from the last 12 months who didn’t book; send a 3‑email sequence: availability update, favorite venues gallery, limited-time bonus (e.g., complimentary engagement mini).
- Drip for new leads who go quiet
  - Day 0: instant email/SMS
  - Day 1: portfolio + testimonial
  - Day 3: packages + FAQs
  - Day 7: “Only X 2025 dates left” + consult link

Track what’s working
- Tag every lead source (Website, Instagram, Google, Vendor, Bridal Show, Referral, Ads).
- Watch conversion by pipeline stage: New Inquiry → Consult Booked → Proposal Sent → Booked.
- Key metrics: response time (target under 5 minutes), consult-book rate, proposal-sent rate, booking rate, and cost per lead (for ads).
